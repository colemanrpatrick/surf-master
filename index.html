          <div class="left_body_top"> <p>This blog is normally about surf and paddling but today something spectacular
            happended. I decided to steal the declaration. There's no reason why, its just funny I guess. I'm gonna
            sell it on ETSY when I get the chance. Hey its crazy I know, but what have you done lately?</P>
            <p>But anyway back to paddling. I remember one time I had this paddle named Louis that I'd take out with
              me on specific thursdays. </p>

            <p class="bottomrighttext">Its long been disputed whether or not junk mail has contributed to surfing but scholars are convinced it has less to do with causation leads to association and more to do with the absurdity of modern
